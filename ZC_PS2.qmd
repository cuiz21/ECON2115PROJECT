# 1) UCTs vs. CCTs for boosting school enrollment

```{r}
d <- read_stata(here("ps1/morocco_for_analysis.dta")) |>
  filter(eligible_child == 1)

d |> select(household_id, indiv_id, wave, group, schoolid, enrolled) |>
  arrange(schoolid, household_id, indiv_id, wave)

```

## a)

```{r}

d_pre <- d %>% filter(wave == 0)

d_pre <- d_pre %>%
  mutate(
    treat_UCT = ifelse(group == 1, 1, 0),
    treat_CCT = ifelse(group > 1, 1, 0)
  )

reg <- lm(lw_father ~ treat_UCT + treat_CCT, data = d_pre)

vcov_clustered <- vcovCR(reg, cluster = d_pre$schoolid, type = "CR2")

joint_test <- linearHypothesis(reg, 
  hypothesis.matrix = c("treat_UCT = 0", "treat_CCT = 0"),
  vcov. = vcov_clustered
)

print(joint_test)
```

## b)

Yes, I did take cluster into account. This is because the treatment
occurred at school level and thus all children from the same school
received the same treatment.

## c)

### i) (1)

Estimate the enrollment increases due to assignment to the UCT group and
the CCT group. Are they statistically significant?

```{r}
d <- read_stata(here('ps1/morocco_for_analysis.dta')) %>%
  filter(eligible_child == 1) %>%
  mutate(assignment = case_when(
    group > 1  ~ "cct",
    group == 1 ~ "uct",
    group == 0 ~ "control"
  )) %>%
  mutate(assignment = factor(assignment) %>% relevel(ref = "control"))

d$cct <- as.numeric(d$assignment == "cct")
d$uct <- as.numeric(d$assignment == "uct")

d_ate <- d %>% filter(wave == 1)

reg_combined <- lm(enrolled ~ assignment, data = d_ate)

reg_combined_clustered <- vcovCR(reg_combined, cluster = d_ate$schoolid, type = "CR2")

coeftest(reg_combined, vcov = reg_combined_clustered)

linearHypothesis(reg_combined, 
                 "assignmentcct = assignmentuct", 
                 vcov. = reg_combined_clustered)
```

For UCT, we see a 8.2% increase. For CCT, we see a 6.6% increase. Both
of these results are statistically significant.

### ii) (1)

Is the difference in enrollment effects between the UCT and CCT
statistically significant at conventional levels (1%, 5%, 10%)?

The p-value is 0.1151, which is above 10%, 5%, and 1% significance
thresholds, not statistically significant at conventional levels 

### d) (2)

Refer to the research article on the *Tayssir* study on Canvas in
"Files/problem_sets/ps1/Benhassine et al. - 2015 - Turning a shove into
a nudge A labeled cash transfer for education.pdf". Based on the article
and your analysis in the previous parts of this question, what do you
conclude the study teaches us about the behavior of the Type II
households we discussed in class in this context?

Type II households are those who are on the edge of sending/not sending
their kids to school. Having a cash transfer program will help them to
send their children to school. Whether it is UCT or CCT does not matter
much, making conditions (compliance, punishment) unnecessary and
increasing overall project cost.

# 2) UCTs and Labor Supply

In this problem, we will look at the effect of providing the *Tayssir*
cash transfer unconditionally on adults' working hours per week. We
define adults as individuals aged 16 and up. The dataset is
`Files/problem_sets/ps2/tayssir_labor_supply.dta` and has the same
structure as `Files/problem_sets/ps1/morocco_for_analysis.dta`, with two
waves, the same group definitions, etc.

## a) (2)

Refer to
`Files/Banerjee et al Debunking the Stereotype of the Lazy Welfare Recipient.pdf`
on Canvas. Draw a graph (you don't need to use R) similar to the ones we
used to analyze enrollment responses, which shows that providing the
unconditional cash transfer (UCT) could reduce adults' hours worked per
week. Label $Y_{0i}$ and $Y_{1i}$.

![](images/1.png)

## b) (2)

Draw a graph which shows that providing the UCT could keep adults' hours
worked per week constant. Label $Y_{0i}$ and $Y_{1i}$.

![](images/2.png)

## c) (1)

Draw a graph which shows that providing the UCT could increase adults'
hours worked per week. Label $Y_{0i}$ and $Y_{1i}$. Hint: what argument
do the authors give for this in the paper?

One potential argument given by author is having extra income allow
women to find child care and therefore able to join the workforce.

![](images/3.png)

## d) (1)

What is Di for this causal question?

Di is the treatment dummy indicator for being treated with the
unconditional cash transfer program.

## e)

### i) (2)

Why can't we calculate $Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$ for any individual?

For any given individual, we observe only one potential outcome of
either Y1 or Y0. We can never see both outcomes for the same person at
the same time.

### ii) (2)

Why does Benhassine et. al. (2015)'s strategy of randomly assigning
household eligibility for the UCT mean we can identify
$E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}]$?

Because households are randomly assigned to be eligible for the UCT, the
treatment and control groups are statistically equivalent in expectation
on all pre-treatment characteristics. This means that any systematic
difference in outcomes between the two groups can be attributed solely
to the UCT. 

## f)

Filter so that you select the pre-treatment wave (`wave == 0`).

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
d <- read_stata(here("ps2/tayssir_labor_supply.dta")) |>
  filter(wave == 0)

```

### i) (2)

Regress `hours_perweek` on an indicator variable for inclusion in the
UCT treatment group and report the results.

```{r}
reg_pre <- lm(hours_perweek ~ control, data = d)

vcov_pre <- vcovCR(reg_pre, cluster = d$schoolid, type = "CR2")

coeftest(reg_pre, vcov = vcov_pre)
```

### ii) (1)

Does the group assigned to the UCT differ in their pre-treatment hours
of work per week compared to the control group in a statistically
significant way, at conventional levels?

The P-value is 0.9839, which is far above the conventional significance
thresholds. There is no statistically significant difference in
pre-treatment hours worked between the UCT group and the control group.

## g) (2)

What does the result from (b) tell us about whether the control group is
made up of "good clones" of the individuals in the treatment group,
according to the terminology in *Impact Evaluation in Practice* Chapter
4?

Because the difference in pre-treatment hours worked between the UCT and
control groups is effectively zero (statistically insignificant), the
control group appears to be a "good clone" of the treatment group---at
least on this key outcome variable (hours worked). In *Impact Evaluation
in Practice* Chapter 4 terminology, this indicates that random
assignment achieved balance on pre-treatment characteristics, making the
control group a valid counterfactual for the treatment group.

## h) (2)

Estimate the effect of the UCT on adults' hours worked.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
d <- read_stata(here("ps2/tayssir_labor_supply.dta")) |>
  filter(wave == 1)

reg_post <- lm(hours_perweek ~ control, data = d)
vcov_post <- vcovCR(reg_post, cluster = d$schoolid, type = "CR2")

coeftest(reg_post, vcov = vcov_post)

```

### i) (1)

Is the effect significantly different from zero at conventional levels?

No. With a p-value of 0.6013, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that
the difference in hours worked (control vs. UCT) is zero. Hence, there
is no statistically significant effect of the UCT on adults' hours
worked at the 1%, 5%, or 10% level.

## 

**j) (3)**

Comment on if/how the results from e), and others discussed in
`Files/Banerjee et al Debunking the Stereotype of the Lazy Welfare Recipient.pdf`
affect your opinion of unconditional cash transfers as a social welfare
policy?

I have previously studied UCT programs. The recreation of the Banerjee
et al. paper suggested that unconditional cash transfers do not cause
large reductions in labor supply. This is in line with the large
quantity of academic discussion that unilaterally find no significant
effect on work hours, partly because recipients use the transfers to
cover basic needs or invest in productivity-enhancing activities. This
validates the value of cash transfers as a social welfare policy. The
stereotype of social welfare nets creating laziness is by far unfounded
and much of a political statement than academic one.

# 3. Capital Gains

Refer to
`Files/Fafchamps et al. - 2014 - Microenterprise growth and the flypaper effect Evidence from a randomized experiment in Ghana.pdf`
for this question.

## a) (2)

What is the primary question that the authors are trying to answer? What
makes it important from a policy perspective?

The primary question is whether providing capital grants to small-scale
entrepreneurs (microenterprises) increases their business profits, and
whether how the grant is provided (cash vs. in-kind) affects outcomes.

There are two major reasons from policy: 1) Policymakers need to know
which form of assistance actually boosts business performance. If
in-kind grants lead to higher profit growth, then designing programs
that restrict recipients to use the grant on business inputs will be
more effective than handing out cash. 2) Understanding the effect helps
ensure that limited resources are used in ways that maximize economic
growth and employment among microentrepreneurs.

## b) (2)

Explain the main finding of the paper (including what the 'flypaper
effect' is) using non-technical jargon, as if you were writing a brief
policy memo.

The study finds that when small business owners receive a grant in the
form of physical goods (in-kind), their profits increase significantly
compared to when they receive the same amount as cash. In simple terms,
the "flypaper effect" means that money given in kind tends to "stick"
with the business whereas cash is more likely to be spent on other
household or consumption needs.

## c) (4)

The authors used a randomized control trial because they believed an
observational analysis of similar policies would be insufficient.
Imagine that another country implemented the investment program without
randomizing treatment, and that you were trying to understand the effect
of this program on food security in that country. What are two possible
confounders (omitted variables) that would bias the results from your
observational analysis? For each confounder, explain in 2-3 sentences
the mechanism of the omitted variable and [use the omitted variable bias
formula]{.underline} to argue whether it would lead to an understatement
or overstatement of the true effect.

Factor 1): Geographical Location. People living in areas with better
roads, markets, and stronger local information systems might find it
easier to learn about and apply for a grant program. Alternately, better
locations also gives lower transportation costs for inputs and higher
selling prices for outputs. Using the OVB: Cov(D1, X)\>0 If participants
are more likely to be in better locations. This leads to a positive bias
(an overestimate). You would mistakenly attribute the benefit of good
infrastructure to the program itself.

Factor 2): Household Wealth. Households that start off wealthier are
more likely to sign up (they can afford any upfront costs, are more
aware of such programs, or meet eligibility criteria more
easily). Cov(D1, X)\>0: If having more wealth makes it more likely to
participate. This leads to an overstatement of the program's true
effect. We'd erroneously assign to the grant the benefits that are
actually due to participants' existing wealth.

## d) (3)

Let Y~0i~ be the business profits in the absence of the grants program
and let D~i~ = 1 denote participation in the program. If there were no
RCT and individuals were allowed to opt-in to the program, critics might
point out that:

$$ E[Y_{0i} | D_i = 1] < E[Y_{0i} | D_i = 0] $$Explain this equation in
words, say explain why it is a problem, and give a plausible scenario in
which the problem may occur

This means that even if individuals who participate in the program did
not receive the grant, they would still have lower business profits on
average than people who do not participate. This shows that participants
are systematically different (in this case, worse off to begin with)
than non-participants. If we simply compare participants' outcomes to
non-participants', we might incorrectly attribute differences in profits
to the program rather than to underlying differences in their initial
circumstances.

A plausible scenario where this problem occurs is if the grant is
targeted toward struggling enterprises or poorer households. Businesses
performing poorly may be more motivated to enroll in a grant program,
but they would have had low profits regardless of the program. 

# 4) RCTs in your own work

The goal of this question is to consider how RCTs can be applied to
evaluate current policy questions interesting to you.

## a) (2)

Propose a specific policy question that could best be answered using an
RCT. Explain the question in non-technical terms in no more than 3-5
sentences. Write mathematically the regression you would run.

Many governments are exploring ways to accelerate the adoption of
low-carbon energy solutions and one way is to offer partial subsidies or
carbon credits to households installing solar panels, thereby lowering
the up-front cost.

The question is: **Does providing such subsidies significantly increase
solar panel adoption?**

A simple way to estimate the program's effect is to regress an outcome
Yi on the treatment indicator Di:

$$Yi=\alpha+\beta Di+\epsilon_i$$

Yi is the solar adoption (a binary indicator of whether household
installed solar). Di is an indicator variable (1 if household i was
offered the subsidy, 0 if not). Beta captures the causal effect of being
offered the subsidy on the outcome of interest. ei is the error term
capturing unobserved factors.

## b) (1)

Describe your treatment group. Propose a comparison group and explain in
a short paragraph why you chose that group.

**Treatment Group**

Households randomly selected to receive the solar subsidy offer (or
carbon credits tied to solar adoption). This group might also receive
informational brochures or installation support.

**Comparison (Control) Group**

Similar households in the same area (matched on characteristics like
income, energy consumption, home type) that do **not** receive the
subsidy offer.

**Why this group?**

By selecting households with comparable baseline conditions yet
withholding the subsidy from the control group, we ensure that any
differences in solar adoption a can be attributed to the financial
incentive rather than pre-existing disparities. This straightforward
comparison allows us to cleanly isolate the impact of the subsidy on
behavior.

## c) (1)

Is it possible that the control group could be "contaminated" as a
result of interacting with the treatment group? Explain in a short
paragraph which measures you would take to limit this contamination. (2
points)

Yes, there is a possibility that some control households might be
influenced by the treatment group's activities---e.g., seeing neighbors
install solar panels could motivate them to do so even without the
financial incentive, or they might share equipment or knowledge.

I can randomize at the neighborhood or community level so that entire
blocks either receive or do not receive the subsidy offer. This reduces
the likelihood of direct spillovers within closeby communities. I can
also collect outcome data relatively soon after the subsidy offer to
minimize the time for neighbors in the control group to imitate or learn
secondhand.
